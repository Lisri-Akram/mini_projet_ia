Heart Disease Patient ClusteringThis project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning to a heart disease dataset. Using K-Means Clustering, the goal is to group patient data into distinct clusters based on clinical features to identify patterns that might indicate different levels of health risks.📋 Table of ContentsOverviewDatasetProject PipelineInstallation & RequirementsUsageEvaluation Metrics🔍 OverviewThe script performs a comprehensive analysis including:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and identifying outliers.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.Feature Scaling: Standardizing data to ensure features contribute equally to distance calculations.Clustering: Implementing the K-Means algorithm and determining the optimal $k$ using the Elbow Method.Dimensionality Reduction: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the resulting clusters in a 2D space. DatasetThe analysis expects a file named heart.csv.Target Removal: The target column is dropped to simulate a true unsupervised learning environment.Categorical Encoding: Features like sex, cp, and thal are one-hot encoded for compatibility with distance-based algorithms.🛠 Project Pipeline1. Data CleaningRemoves duplicate entries.Handles missing values via dropping (if any).Visualizes outliers using box plots and relationships via scatter plots.2. Finding the "Elbow"The script iterates through $k=1$ to $k=10$ to calculate Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).Note: Based on the Elbow Method, $k=3$ was selected as the optimal number of clusters for this analysis.3. VisualizationSince the dataset is high-dimensional (many features), we apply PCA to reduce the data to two principal components (PC1 and PC2). This allows us to plot the clusters on a 2D scatter plot to observe how well the groups are separated. Installation & RequirementsTo run this script, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:Bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
 UsageEnsure heart.csv is in the same directory as the script.Run the script:Bashpython heart_clustering.py
 Evaluation MetricsThe model is evaluated using three key metrics:Inertia: Measures how tightly the clusters are packed.Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters (ranges from -1 to 1).Davies-Bouldin Index: The ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances (lower is better).
